# Operators

Omm, like most programming languages, uses operators to perform tasks. The list of Omm's operators are shown here:

| Name | Function |
|:----:|:---------:|
|+|Addition and string concatenation|
|-|Subtraction|
|*|Multiplication|
|/|Division|
|%|Modulus|
|^|Exponentiation|
|::|Indexing|
|=|Assignment|
|:=|Declaration|
|->|Type casts|
|<-|Synchronous call|
|<~|Asynchronous call|
|==|Equality|
|!=|Inequality|
|<|Less than|
|>|Greater than|
|<=|Less than or equal|
|>=|Greater than or equal|
|!|Not|
|&|And|
|\||Or

Omm also has some operators that are automatically inserted at compile-time, such as ~ (connection), and => (function body). However, these do not need to be known unless you would like to maintain Omm.
