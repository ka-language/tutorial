# Installing Omm

The Omm installations can be found [here](http://omm.zone/downloads.html) (Currently only have downloads for windows).

If you have a linux/macos OS or if you like to zipped files instead of installers, you can go to the raw download and unzip the files. Then, add the unzipped folder to your `$PATH`.
